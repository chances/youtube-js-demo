#YouTube Search Toy

A little example project to demonstrate the use of JavaScript for the Computer Action Team Braindump I gave on and introduction to JavaScript on Friday, January 31, 2014.

This toy performs a search with the YouTube API for a video given a query and renders the results to a list. It also makes use of the [jQuery API](https://jquery.com/).
